# JVM-Compiler #

An object oriented and functional language that runs on the JVM.

The language syntax is similar to that of Java and Scala and uses indentation instead of curly braces for defining blocks of code.

The target is to create a language that is highly scalable and readable to allow for fast development and easier debugging.
